# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Input for the blue Globitek website is not being sanitized before being used in an SQL query
* Entering SQL injection instead of proper salesperson id causes website to stall

	- If username is correct, message "Log in was unsuccessful." will be in bold.
