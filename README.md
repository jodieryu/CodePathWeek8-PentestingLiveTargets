# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Input for the blue Globitek website is not being sanitized before being used in an SQL query
* Entering SQL injection instead of proper salesperson id causes website to stall

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration
* Green Globitek website has username enumeration vulnerability. 
	- If username is correct, message "Log in was unsuccessful." will be in bold.
	- If username is incorrect, message "Log in was unsuccessful." will have no text decorations. 
* Red and blue websites will always have bolded message for correct or incorrect username inputs.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference

	- If id is changed to 10 in URL, attacker can access salesperson that isn't public yet.
